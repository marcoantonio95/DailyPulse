# DailyPulse

## Overview
- DailyPulse is a cross-platform mobile app designed to fetch the latest news from an API, store the data locally, and present it in an intuitive interface. This project was built to enhance my skills in Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and SwiftUI, focusing on cross-platform app development.

## Motivation
- The goal of DailyPulse was to explore the integration of KMP, Compose, and SwiftUI while creating a smooth experience for fetching and displaying news. The challenge was to build a native-feeling app that works seamlessly on both Android and iOS with a shared codebase, ensuring high performance and usability.

## Technologies Used
- Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP): Shared business logic across Android and iOS.
- Jetpack Compose: UI implementation for Android.
- SwiftUI: UI implementation for iOS.
- SQLDelight Database: Local storage of fetched news.
- Ktor: API requests and data fetching.
- Koin: Manage dependency injection.

## Features
- Fetches the latest news from an API.
- Offline storage for viewing news without an internet connection.
